## Why present such a license?

Because I have the following thought: `I don't want to use a developer's product without the developer's knowledge.`  
In order to develop a development product, it takes a certain amount of time, creativity, and the ability to make it into something. It is unacceptable to use this without understanding.

In principle, all conversations will be conducted in Japanese, and in other languages ​​basically using translation.  
Regarding usage rights, all the description in `jaoLICENSE.md` written in Japanese is given priority, and if any difference occurs, the contents written in `jaoLICENSE.md` will apply.
